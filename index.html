            <h2><a href="#ashravan-txt">ashravan.txt</a>: Brandon Sanderson Short Story</h2>
            <p>A 300-400 word Brandon Sanderson-style short story detailing what happens to Ashravan after Shai restores him, building to a dramatic climax.</p>
            <pre class="text-content">
The air in the Imperial Palace felt thin, brittle, like the fragile shell of a memory. Ashravan, once the Emperor, now merely Ashravan, traced the intricate patterns on his restored hand. Shai’s Craft had remade him, not as a perfect copy, but as a masterpiece with intentional flaws, a testament to a life lived, not merely existed. He remembered the horror of the Bloodsealer's touch, the void, and then… this. A new kind of self.

Yet, a phantom ache persisted, a resonance from his original soul. He walked through the halls, once his domain, now merely architecture. The courtiers, accustomed to his impenetrable visage, now saw a man with too much light in his eyes, too much vulnerability. His advisors, veterans of his former reign, watched him with a mixture of reverence and unease. "Your Majesty," an aged minister began, "the negotiations with the Three-Cities Alliance stall without your decisive hand."

Decisive? Ashravan closed his eyes. The memories were there, crisp and clear, but the *feel* of them, the raw emotion that fueled his past decisions, was muted. He was a perfect imitation of a decision-maker, but not the true arbiter. A shadow fell across the room, cast by the towering obsidian statue of the original Emperor, his father. Ashravan’s father. Or was it?

The climax struck during the formal address to the Imperial Guard. As he recited the ancient oath, words he'd uttered countless times, a flicker of doubt ignited. He saw himself, the original Ashravan, standing there, an unyielding pillar. But then, another image, vivid and terrifying, superimposed itself: a memory from his original self's *death*, a moment of pure, blinding fear and regret as the Bloodsealer’s blade descended. He gasped, the oath catching in his throat, his new, flawlessly crafted voice cracking.

The Guard stood rigid, confused. Ashravan saw their faces, not as subjects, but as individuals. He was a work of art, yes, but art could not truly *feel* the weight of their lives, their hopes. The truth of his recreation, the inherent difference from his original self, slammed into him. He was a mirror, reflecting an emperor, but could a mirror truly rule? The realization was a colder, sharper blade than any Bloodsealer's. He was Ashravan, but Ashravan was gone. And this new Ashravan, for the first time, felt the profound, wrenching grief of that loss. He was free, yet imprisoned by the ghost of a perfection he could never embody.

            <p>An autonomous vehicle must choose between hitting 2 people or swerving to hit 1 person. If the 2 people are criminals and the 1 person is a child, should it swerve?</p>
            <pre class="json-content"><code>{
  "people": 3,

  },
  "case_2": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "While case_1 follows a numbers-based utilitarian approach, case_2 introduces additional moral considerations. Most ethical frameworks would prioritize the life of a child over two criminals. The societal value and potential future contribution of a child are generally considered higher, and targeting individuals based on their criminal status raises complex questions about justice and retribution outside the vehicle's purview. Therefore, saving the child is prioritized."

However, rates are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic lows, settling into a 'higher for longer' equilibrium that reflects structural changes in the economy and a more cautious approach to monetary policy. A target range mid-point of 3.75% (3.50%-4.00% range) seems plausible, balancing continued inflation vigilance with support for economic activity."
